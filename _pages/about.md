## Hello and Welcome! 👋  

I'm an experienced **Oil & Gas professional turned AI & Machine Learning researcher**, specializing in **industrial AI, defense applications, and data science**.  

Currently, I am a **Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at SRM Institute of Science and Technology**, working on a **DRDO-funded project** focused on **Explainable AI (XAI) for sonar image detection and classification**. My research involves developing **AI-driven solutions for defense**, improving **model interpretability**, and enhancing **sonar image analysis techniques** for autonomous systems.  

Previously, I worked as a **Machine Learning Data Associate at Amazon**, where I contributed to **machine learning model development**, handling **large-scale datasets, annotation tasks, and data preprocessing** to enhance AI-driven products.  

Before transitioning into AI, I had a career in the **Oil & Gas industry**, managing **shutdowns, maintenance activities, and risk mitigation** while ensuring operational efficiency. These experiences helped me build strong **leadership, analytical, and decision-making skills** in high-pressure environments.  

My passion lies in **AI research, computer vision, and real-world machine learning applications**. With a **multidisciplinary background**, I aim to bridge the gap between **research and industry**, particularly in **defense, surveillance, and autonomous systems**.  

I hold a **Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science from Deakin University**, a **Post Graduate Program in AI & ML from The University of Texas at Austin**, and a **Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, Chennai**.  

I'm always eager to collaborate on cutting-edge AI research and innovative projects. **Feel free to connect with me!**

<p>I'm an experienced <strong>Oil & Gas professional turned AI & Machine Learning researcher</strong>, specializing in <strong>industrial AI, defense applications, and data science</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a <strong>Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at SRM Institute of Science and Technology</strong>, working on a <strong>DRDO-funded project</strong> focused on <strong>Explainable AI (XAI) for sonar image detection and classification</strong>. My research, advised by <a href="https://www.srmist.edu.in/faculty/dr-athira-m-nambiar/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Athira. M. Nambiar</strong></a>, aims to enhance **AI-driven defense solutions**, improve **model interpretability**, and advance **sonar image analysis techniques** for autonomous systems.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as a <strong>Machine Learning Data Associate at Amazon</strong>, contributing to <strong>machine learning model development</strong>, handling <strong>large-scale datasets, annotation tasks, and data preprocessing</strong> to enhance AI-driven products.</p>

<p>Before transitioning into AI, I worked in the <strong>Oil & Gas industry</strong>, managing <strong>shutdowns, maintenance, and risk mitigation</strong> while ensuring operational efficiency. This background helped me develop <strong>leadership, analytical, and decision-making skills</strong> in high-pressure environments.</p>

<p>My passion lies in <strong>AI research, computer vision, and real-world machine learning applications</strong>. With a <strong>multidisciplinary background</strong>, I aim to bridge the gap between <strong>research and industry</strong>, particularly in <strong>defense, surveillance, and autonomous systems</strong>.</p>

<p>I hold a <strong>Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science from Deakin University</strong>, a <strong>Post Graduate Program in AI & ML from The University of Texas at Austin</strong>, and a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, Chennai</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm always eager to collaborate on cutting-edge AI research and innovative projects. <strong>Feel free to connect with me!</strong></p>
